## Summary

Experienced software engineer and tech lead specializing in PHP/Symfony and cloud-native DevOps platforms. I take a holistic engineering approach across architecture, delivery and operations: clean codebases, automated tests, repeatable and reliable deployments and reliable production systems.

I combine deep hands-on expertise with leadership experience in cross-functional teams, both as a tech lead and in disciplinary leadership roles. I value clear technical communication, pragmatic decision-making, strong software quality and sustainable team processes.

Focus areas: PHP, Symfony, Kubernetes/Helm, CI/CD, Docker, Linux, Ansible, Caddy, and security/compliance-adjacent topics in engineering.
