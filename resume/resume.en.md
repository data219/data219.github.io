## Summary

Experienced software engineer with a focus on PHP and Symfony and a strong emphasis on scalable architectures, cloud-native technologies, and infrastructure automation. I follow a holistic engineering approach — from clean codebases to automated testing and deployments through continuous optimization of development and operations processes.

I combine deep technical expertise with leadership experience in cross-functional teams — both as a Tech Lead and in disciplinary leadership roles. I place great value on software quality, clear technical communication, and sustainable solutions in a team context. Beyond delivery, I value close collaboration with product owners and stakeholders to shape sound, scalable, and economically viable solutions.

Technology focus: PHP, Symfony, Kubernetes and Helm, CI/CD, Docker/containers, Linux, Ansible, Caddy, and modern cloud and DevOps platforms.

Agile development processes, continuous learning, and an open team culture where quality and efficiency go hand in hand are essential to me. I am looking for a role where technical excellence and the strategic evolution of modern software landscapes are central — ideally, but not necessarily, combined with leadership responsibilities.
